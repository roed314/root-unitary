June Ju and Everett Howe: telling whether an abelian variety is absolutely simple
Look at primes dividing discriminant of Weil field, products at most 4g^2.
Find pairwise r, hash on multiple r
Supersingular if and only if the ultimate field is Q

For Stefano
-----------

We'll be doing isogeny classes that Stefano has already computed, plus:

 * Any g, q
 * ordinary or C-S (q=p, no real roots), squarefree
 * Z[F,V] = maximal order

For each isogeny class, write lines to two files

 * isomorphism_classes.txt (one line per ideal)
```
isog_label:frac_ideal:rep_type:is_reduced:cm_elt:is_product
e.g.
1.251.v:{{1,0},{0,1}}:0:f:{21,2}:f
